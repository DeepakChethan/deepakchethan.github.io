It has been a seriously long time for me since I truely contributed to OSS (not counting hacktoberfest). So I guess now is the best time to do that. 

I am planning on contributing to these three projects:

* radare2: 
  - Going back to the roots, I always loved the project so I'd rather work on the ESIL part of the project.
* springboot:
  - I use it on a daily basis and its only fair I give back something to it.
* Couchdb:
  - This is still not confirmed, I am checking with my employer before I dive deeper.

It's time I give back!
