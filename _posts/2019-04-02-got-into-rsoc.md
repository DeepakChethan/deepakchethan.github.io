title: "Got Selected to RSoC!"
category: "code"
---

After so many sleepless nights (cause I'm dumb) and over 20 patches and a 3-page proposal to Radare2, I got selected to RSoC! Probably the biggest achievement to date. I am so grateful for this opportunity and I'll try my best to not let anyone down (especially myself).

I will spend this summer enhancing the UI (or at least try) of radare2. In the process learn tons of stuff.

I will keep updating the status of this project every week, for my sake.

cheers!
