After so many sleepless nights (cause I'm dumb) and over 20 patches and a 3-page proposal to Radare2, I got selected to RSoC! Probably the biggest achievement to date. I am so grateful for this opportunity and I'll try my best to not let anyone down (especially myself).

I will spend this summer enhancing the UI (or at least try) of radare2. In the process learn tons of stuff.

cheers!
