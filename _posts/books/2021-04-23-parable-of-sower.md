This book was recommended to me by the kind folks on r/books (reddit) and is a science fiction book about nightmarish dystopian future (my favorite kind of genre) where everyone is trying to survive with very little resources available to them, thus creating fights, deaths and the civilization as we know it.

It is a journal of teenager Lauren Olamina who suffers from "hyper-empathy" mostly talking about her take on life and religion. Her idea of god being "inevitable change" and going with the flow instead of fighting it was fascinating. She starts the book while living in a well protected (as protected as it can be in the chaos) community and a good family. Both of which are taken away from her eventually. Then begins a journey to the north with a couple of her friends from her old community and finds quite a many interesting people along the way, including her new boyfriend who persuades to go to her sisters farmland instead; but sadly they reach too late the fire people do their thing. Then she ultimately decides to create a community "Earth seed" in her "boyfriends" farmland with all the new people with them.



It was definitely a fun read, and I'm looking forward to seeing what happens in the "Parable of the Talents".
