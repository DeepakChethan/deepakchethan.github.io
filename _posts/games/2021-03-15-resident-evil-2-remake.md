I always wanted to play this game after watching all the movies that were made after it and finally took the plunge with this game. RE 2 first game I played in this franchise and unsurprisingly I found it a bit difficult as I was new to all the mechanics but eventually got the hang of it.

The game is definitely out of the genres that I like to usually play, with all the childish (debatable) puzzles in an otherwise very serious zombie outbreak. It definitely spooked me more than I'd like admit, but I guess it's a good thing. I played as Leon Kennedy for the first run and Claire Redfield for the second, there were more differences in gameplay than I anticipated, so I'm glad I went with the second run. 

They were good stories (plural cause 2), and I was immersed. While helping Leon on his first day on his job as cop and claire find her brother, I had to fight the same bosses over and over again; but they evolved each time. There were a lot of twists that I didn't foresee. That being said Mr. X can go f himself.

It's safe to say that I am hooked and would definitely play RE3 next.
